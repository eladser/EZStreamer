# üîç Debug Guide: Spotify Authentication Loading Issue

## **What I Just Added**

I've completely rewritten the Spotify authentication with **extensive debugging** to identify exactly where it's getting stuck. The new version includes:

- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive debug logging** - Every step is logged to Debug output
- ‚úÖ **Better error handling** - Specific error messages for each failure point
- ‚úÖ **Step-by-step initialization** - Clear sequence to identify bottlenecks
- ‚úÖ **Server status tracking** - Confirms server actually starts
- ‚úÖ **WebView2 monitoring** - Tracks browser initialization and navigation

## **üö® IMMEDIATE DEBUGGING STEPS**

### **Step 1: Check Debug Output**
1. **Run EZStreamer in Visual Studio** (not standalone)
2. **Open Output window** ‚Üí Select "Debug" from dropdown
3. **Click "Test Connection"** for Spotify
4. **Watch the debug output** - it will show exactly where it gets stuck

### **Step 2: Look for These Key Messages**
```
‚úÖ SpotifyAuthWindow initialized with ClientId: SET
‚úÖ SpotifyAuthWindow initialized with ClientSecret: SET
üîÑ Starting authentication initialization...
‚úÖ HTTP server started successfully on http://localhost:8443/
üåê Navigating WebView to Spotify authorization...
```

### **Step 3: Identify the Problem**
The debug output will show you **exactly** where it fails:

#### **If you see "ClientId: NOT SET" or "ClientSecret: NOT SET"**
‚Üí **Problem**: Credentials not saved properly
‚Üí **Fix**: Re-enter and save credentials in Settings

#### **If you see "Failed to start local server"**
‚Üí **Problem**: Port 8443 is blocked or in use
‚Üí **Fix**: Run as Administrator or check port usage

#### **If server starts but no navigation**
‚Üí **Problem**: WebView2 initialization issue
‚Üí **Fix**: Install/update WebView2 Runtime

#### **If navigation starts but no callback**
‚Üí **Problem**: Spotify redirect URI mismatch
‚Üí **Fix**: Update Spotify app redirect URI

## **üîß Most Likely Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue 1: Port 8443 Permission Error**
**Symptoms**: "Failed to start local server" in debug output
**Fix**: 
```bash
# Run Command Prompt as Administrator, then:
netsh http add urlacl url=http://localhost:8443/ user=Everyone
```
OR just **run EZStreamer as Administrator**

### **Issue 2: WebView2 Runtime Missing**
**Symptoms**: WebView initialization fails or browser doesn't appear
**Fix**: 
1. Download **Microsoft WebView2 Runtime** from Microsoft
2. Install and restart EZStreamer

### **Issue 3: Spotify App Configuration**
**Symptoms**: Server starts, navigation works, but no callback received
**Fix**: In [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard):
- **Redirect URI must be exactly**: `http://localhost:8443/callback`
- **No trailing slash, no HTTPS**
- **Save the app settings**

### **Issue 4: Windows Firewall**
**Symptoms**: Server starts but external connections blocked
**Fix**: 
1. **Windows Defender Firewall** ‚Üí **Allow an app**
2. **Add EZStreamer.exe** to allowed apps
3. **Allow both Private and Public networks**

## **üìã Complete Testing Checklist**

1. **Credentials Check**:
   - [ ] Client ID entered and saved in Settings
   - [ ] Client Secret entered and saved in Settings
   - [ ] Both show as "SET" in debug output

2. **Server Check**:
   - [ ] Debug shows "HTTP server started successfully"
   - [ ] No "Failed to start local server" errors
   - [ ] Port 8443 is not used by other apps

3. **Spotify App Check**:
   - [ ] Redirect URI: `http://localhost:8443/callback`
   - [ ] Authorization Code Flow enabled
   - [ ] App settings saved

4. **Browser Check**:
   - [ ] WebView2 Runtime installed
   - [ ] Debug shows "Navigation starting to: https://accounts.spotify.com..."
   - [ ] Browser window actually appears

5. **Callback Check**:
   - [ ] Debug shows "Received HTTP request" when you authorize
   - [ ] Debug shows "Authorization code: RECEIVED"
   - [ ] Token exchange completes

## **üéØ Quick Test Commands**

### **Test Port 8443 Availability**
Run in Command Prompt:
```bash
netstat -an | findstr :8443
```
If anything shows up, that port is in use.

### **Test HTTP Server Manually**
After starting EZStreamer, open browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8443/
```
You should see a connection error (normal) but no "can't connect" error.

## **üìû Share Debug Output**

When you test, **copy the entire debug output** and share it. It will show exactly:
- Which step fails
- What error occurs
- Whether server starts
- Whether browser navigates
- Whether callback is received

This will let me give you the **exact fix** for your specific issue.

## **üÜò Emergency Fallback**

If OAuth still doesn't work after debugging, I can implement a **different approach**:
1. **Use device code flow** (no local server needed)
2. **Use implicit flow** (token in URL fragment)
3. **Enhanced manual token workflow**

But let's debug the current implementation first to see exactly where it's failing!

**Next Step**: Run in Visual Studio, check debug output, and share what you see when it gets stuck. This will pinpoint the exact issue! üîç
