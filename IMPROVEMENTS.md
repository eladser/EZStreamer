# EZStreamer - Major Improvements & Fixes

This document outlines all the major improvements, bug fixes, and enhancements made to EZStreamer.

## 🎉 What's New

### ✅ Spotify Authentication - Completely Overhauled
**Problem:** The previous implementation was overly complex with 1500+ lines of HTTPS certificate handling code, requiring administrator privileges and frequently failing.

**Solution:**
- Simplified from HTTPS to HTTP callback server (Spotify allows `http://localhost` for development)
- Removed ~500 lines of complex certificate binding code
- No longer requires administrator privileges
- Changed redirect URI from `https://localhost:8443/callback` to `http://localhost:8888/callback`
- Much more reliable and easier to set up

**Files Changed:**
- `src/EZStreamer/Views/SpotifyAuthWindow.xaml.cs` - Completely simplified

### ✅ Spotify Token Refresh - Now Automatic
**Problem:** Spotify tokens would expire after 1 hour, requiring manual re-authentication.

**Solution:**
- Implemented automatic token refresh mechanism
- Tokens are now automatically refreshed before expiration
- Refresh tokens are securely stored in encrypted settings
- Added `SpotifyRefreshToken` and `SpotifyTokenExpiry` fields to settings

**Files Changed:**
- `src/EZStreamer/Services/SpotifyService.cs` - Added token refresh logic
- `src/EZStreamer/Models/Models.cs` - Added new token fields
- `src/EZStreamer/Views/SpotifyAuthWindow.xaml.cs` - Saves refresh tokens

**Benefits:**
- No more manual re-authentication every hour
- Seamless long-term streaming sessions
- Better user experience

### ✅ YouTube Music Integration - Real API Implementation
**Problem:** YouTube Music integration was completely fake with hardcoded song lists and 12-second demo playback.

**Solution:**
- Implemented real YouTube Data API v3 integration
- Actual song search using YouTube's API
- Real video metadata (titles, artists, durations, thumbnails)
- Proper ISO 8601 duration parsing
- Actual song durations instead of fake 12-second demos

**Files Changed:**
- `src/EZStreamer/Services/YouTubeMusicService.cs` - Complete rewrite

**Features:**
- Real-time YouTube search results
- Accurate song metadata
- Proper thumbnail support
- Music category filtering
- API key validation

### ✅ Code Quality Improvements

**Removed:**
- ~500 lines of certificate-related code
- Duplicate `SpotifyTokenResponse` class
- Unused cryptography imports
- Fake song generation code

**Added:**
- Proper error handling
- Comprehensive logging
- Better API validation
- Cleaner code structure

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. Spotify Configuration

1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Create a new app or use existing one
3. **IMPORTANT:** Add this redirect URI: `http://localhost:8888/callback`
4. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret
5. In EZStreamer, go to Settings → Spotify API Credentials
6. Enter your Client ID and Secret
7. Click "Test Connection" to authenticate

**Note:** The redirect URI has changed from `https://localhost:8443/callback` to `http://localhost:8888/callback`. Make sure to update this in your Spotify app settings.

### 2. YouTube Configuration

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable YouTube Data API v3
4. Create API credentials (API Key)
5. Copy your API key
6. In EZStreamer, go to Settings → YouTube API Credentials
7. Enter your API Key
8. Click "Test Connection" to validate

### 3. Twitch Configuration

1. Go to https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps
2. Register a new application
3. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret
4. In EZStreamer, go to Settings → Twitch Configuration
5. Enter your credentials and channel name

### 4. OBS Configuration (Optional)

1. Install OBS WebSocket plugin (if not already installed)
2. Configure WebSocket server in OBS (default: `localhost:4455`)
3. Set a password (recommended)
4. In EZStreamer, go to Settings → OBS Settings
5. Enter server IP, port, and password
6. Click "Test Connection"

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Architecture Improvements

**Before:**
- Complex HTTPS server with certificate management
- Administrator privileges required
- Hardcoded fake data for YouTube
- No token refresh
- Duplicate code across files

**After:**
- Simple HTTP callback server
- No special privileges needed
- Real API integrations
- Automatic token management
- Clean, maintainable code

### Security Enhancements

- Tokens still encrypted using Windows DPAPI
- Refresh tokens securely stored
- Better error handling to prevent token leakage
- API keys validated before use

### Performance Improvements

- Removed unnecessary process killing
- Eliminated netsh/PowerShell calls
- Faster authentication flow
- More responsive UI

## 🐛 Known Issues Fixed

1. ✅ Spotify authentication requiring admin privileges
2. ✅ HTTPS certificate binding failures
3. ✅ Tokens expiring without refresh
4. ✅ YouTube showing fake/demo songs
5. ✅ Hardcoded 12-second song durations
6. ✅ Duplicate model classes
7. ✅ Complex error messages mentioning SSL/certificates

## 📝 Migration Notes

If you were using the old version:

### Spotify Users:
1. Update your Spotify app's redirect URI to `http://localhost:8888/callback`
2. Re-authenticate in EZStreamer
3. Your refresh token will be saved for automatic renewal

### YouTube Users:
1. Get a YouTube Data API v3 key (previously not required)
2. Configure it in Settings
3. Enjoy real YouTube search results!

## 🎯 What's Next?

Potential future improvements:
- WebView2-based YouTube player window
- Channel Points integration for Twitch
- Custom overlay themes
- Song history and analytics
- Playlist import/export
- Blacklist/whitelist for songs
- User request cooldowns
- Vote-skip functionality

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

1. **Keep API credentials secure** - Don't share screenshots with credentials
2. **Use your own API keys** - The default demo keys have rate limits
3. **Test thoroughly** - Use "Test Connection" buttons before going live
4. **Monitor logs** - Check Output window for diagnostic information
5. **Backup settings** - Export settings before major changes

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Output/Debug window for error messages
2. Verify API credentials are correct
3. Ensure redirect URIs match exactly
4. Check that APIs are enabled in their respective dashboards
5. Verify port 8888 is not in use by another application
